He come to me with money in his hand
He offered me, I didn't ask him
I wasn't knocking someone's door down, I was running from that
When I got out, I was in that
I was already through that, I had that
I had the studio
I went to the studio
I went to Fox studios
I had it all, and I looked at it and said, "This is a bigger jail than I just got out of"
I don't want to take my time going to work
I got a motorcycle and a sleeping bag and ten or fifteen girls
What the hell I wanna go off into and go to work for?
Work for what, money? I got all the money in the world
I'm the king, man
I run the underworld, guy
I decide whos does what and where they do it at
What am I gonna run around and act like I'm some teenybopper somewhere for somebody else's money?
I make the money, man
I roll the nickels
The game is mine
Beware
I close my eyes and seize it (Seize it)
I clench my fists and beat it (Beat it)
I light my torch and burn it (Burn it)
I am the beast I worship
I close my eyes and seize it (Seize it)
I clench my fists and beat it (Beat it)
I light my torch and burn it (Burn it)
I am the beast I worship
And I know soon come my time for in mine void a pale horse burns
But I fear not the time I'm taken past the point of no return
Wage war like no tomorrow 'cause no hell, there won't be one
For all who deny the struggle, the triumphant overcome
Trips to where few have been out of thin ai, upon high winds
Rites begin when the sun descends, have felt what few will ever know
Have seen the truth beneath the glow of the ebb and flow, where roots of all mysteries grow
I am below, so far below the bottom line
Transmitting live, transmissions rise from the depths out of controlled by
Suspended glance of an unblinking eyes, imminent gaze cast 'pon the path that winds
'Pon the path I find, and claim as mine to ride the waves of unrest
Made to make me shine as a testament to why the ways of the blind will never get
Shit but shanked by my disrespect, dismiss this life, worship death
Cold blood night of serpent's breath, exhaled like spells from the endlessness
In the bottomless wells of emptiness, channeled to invoke what we represent
Secret order, elitist horde of creeping fire seizing power
Riders of the lupus hour, eye on palm, time is gone
Moonlight drawn, fly till dawn, sacrifice to rise beyond
Deep inside the violent calm of the coming storm in blood sworn
To glorify and for life adorn with all that dies to become unborn
I close my eyes and seize it (Seize it)
I clench my fists and beat it (Beat it)
I light my torch and burn it (Burn it)
I am the beast I worship
I close my eyes and seize it (Seize it)
I clench my fists and beat it (Beat it)
I light my torch and burn it (Burn it)
I am the beast I worship
I am the beast I worship
In the time before time eyes 'bove which horns curve like psychotropic scythes
And smell of torn flesh bled dry by hell swarms of pestis flies
Vomiting forth flames lit by an older than ancient force
That slays this life with no remorse, the spiral storm of flames inside
The torch I raise, the force I ride
Feel my vessel go up in flames, flesh torch lit by thee unnamed
Direct connection to the source, vestment of unnatural force
Forever burning black torch, wisdom of the old and true
Possessed by the chosen few, shining to reveal the ways
Of a darkness that pervades all that is and ever was
Inferno of witches blood, worship is not on bended knee
Nature knows not of mercy, to pray is to accept defeat
Power pisses on the weak, bow and beheaded by the beast
Beggar on a bitches leash, scum is desperate for relief
Worship is the way I ride, witching currents through the eye
Of storms that force the false to die, worship the flames with which I rise
Into apocalyptic skies
Harsh winds flay mine flesh to bone in splintered skeleton I roam
Wastelands with naught to call my own but the path I walk alone
The hunger burns within my gut as my bones turn into dust
And I know soon come my time for in mine void a pale horse burns
But I fear not the time I'm taken past the point of no return
Wage war like no tomorrow 'cause no hell, there won't be one
For all who deny the struggle, the triumphant overcome
I close my eyes and seize it
I clench my fists and beat it
I light my torch and burn it
I am the beast I worship
I close my eyes and seize it
I clench my fists and beat it
I light my torch and burn it
I am the beast I worship
I am the beast I worship
What up?
Man uh see what's going on with it
In case you guys got to see about being hidden out here
They're gonna come to our smoke town
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, hyuh
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
Guillotine... yuh!
Sit in the dark and ponder how I'm fit to make the bottom
Fall through the floor and they all fall down, yuh!
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes, yuh!
Out of the shadows barrage of witch tongue
Cobra spit over apocalyptic cult
Killer cauldron smoke Stomp music seriously, yuh!
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes...
Can't stop the groove licks jaws clear off them locks relentless raw movement
Fit to knock you from here to that g-spot body rock connected
To everything you want, ever did want, we got it why not come get it
Stick your head in that hole and watch me drop this cold guillotine death sentence, yuh!
Yuh!
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
Guillotine... yuh!
Hidden art, between and beneath, every fragmented, figure of speech
Tongue in reverse, whenever the beat, causes my jaws to call
Ah! Ah! Ah ah! Yuh!
The screens flashing red, can't see shit but heads
Spinning exorcist like planets out of orbit off the edge
Off mine axis whipping through doors to far more than all that's ever been said, yuh!
Tie the chord kick the chair and you're dead, yuh!
Yuh!
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
Guillotine... yuh!
Guillotine... yuh!
Head of a trick in a bucket, body of a trick in a bag
And thrown in the fire like fuck it, gotta burn it before it goes bad
One too many times been disgusted by the stench of rot is such a drag, yuh!
Get broke by the street like blood stained glass, yuh!
Choke on these nuts till the very last, yuh!
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes...
Serial number, killing machine, the illest of means
To an end built on the filthy sound, you're experiencing, yuh!
Yuh!
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
Guillotine... yuh!
Guillotine... yuh!
Tinted windows, bulletproof, the slip knot fixing rope to noose
To the grave stone grinder of cold steel, the passion that blinds me so I feel, yuh!
Can't let go, no it flows through our veins
Blows through our tunnels and rattles our chains
And they all fall down, yuh!
Yuh!
Yuh!
Yuh!
Yuh!
Yuh!
Yuh!
Yuh!
Yuh!
Spread eagle cross the block
Spread eagle cross the block
Spread eagle cross the block
I fuck the music, I make it cum
I fuck the music with my serpent tongue
Hit, hit, hit
Wanna beer, have no fear, comes and goes, man it's here
No one knows, feels so weird when it blows through my bones
I got a jones for it, I wanna know more 'cause it's 'bout what I got to show for it
I want some more of it, I want too much
I got so bored with it, I shot it up
Wanna light my torch with it and get all fucked up, yeah
What is it, where is it, how will it affect me?
Fuck that shit, I need that shits bound to be the death of me
Fuck buying it, I'm taking it and sharing it with nobody
'Cause all I really need is some cool shit to mob
Like driving down the street to the beat of a blowjob
I own that shit, on some throwback shit, you already know that shit
You even know 'bout how I know the man who grows that, biatch
You can't buy it with your money, you can't find it overseas
It's one of those things that seems outlandish till you have, it's not a dream
As for me, I'm cool with it and that's all right 'cause it's my thing
What is it, where is it, how will it affect me?
Work that angle till it's beveled, curve of the blade doubled
Edge made to bleed the struggle, best believe the game's a hustle
Observer of the strange occurrences, conjurer of the subtle
Unseen but felt disturbances that burst a bitch's bubble
That's right it's all mine, it's all mine never was yours
Like how you wait in line while I walk straight through the door, straight through it
Hear you say something but ain't nothing, spectators ignored
Pay no mind to that chump's, just a player hatin' whore, yeah
I fuck the music, I make it cum
I fuck the music with my serpent tongue
Ain't no fun if the aliens can't have none
How I fuck it dirty, how I make it twitch and scream
How it screams, "Oh baby hurt me, work me to the bone oh please"
How I bend the rhythm over and hit, hit, hit it on my knees
Give, give, give it up, I need it all the time
Bleed it on the drop of a dime, down to pound it till it shines
Moonlit lake of blood red wine, make no mistake, I makes it mine
Break shit down and make it grind to the groove used to align
The cascading shades of jaded blues with these rhymes
Nuclear steeze creeps and winds through secrets behind and between every time I scream
"Shit is mine, it's all mine, all the time, shit is mine"
What is it, where is it, how will it affect me
Fuck that shit, I need that shit, yeah
Thought you knew, thought you thought, thought you did but did not
Come on through what you got, is it cool, is it hot?
Check one two, man don't stop, I'm not through black blood clot
In my view like that twat spread eagle cross the block
Spread eagle cross the block
Spread eagle cross the block
Spread eagle cross the block
Need no ego to rock, what we know just gets dropped, how we keep shit on lock
'Cause all I really need is some cool shit to mob
Like driving down the street to the beat of a blowjob
Shit is mine, it's all mine, all the time, shit is mine
Into the flame, into the fire
With no regard for a thing
Fuck that I'm the lord of the game
I rule this empire
(I am the God of hell fire)
Lord of the game
Born to reign above all that you claim to know beyond a doubt
'Cause no one has came even close to the train of thought we drop like neutron bombs from the tower
Control this and bang this, then watch it rise higher
Than anything seen in your entire
Life spent in chains, sonic live wire
Electrified rain from the (Lips of the driver)
Whippin' the wheel, flippin' donuts to peel
Out on the face of the base, where's my lighter?
Need it to kill one more and chill while I feel it so much my gut burns like the tires
Movin' this movement of real shit inspired
By all that has come before this and was done for the real ones packin' real guns loaded with power
Shower the slums with power from the war marching drums that have come to devour
The weakness that runs when we come (Fuckin' cowards)
When they tell you you must take it (You think hell no)
Got a bad feeling and can't shake it (Hits so low)
When they tell you you must take it (You think hell no)
Got a bad feeling and can't shake it (Hits so low)
When they tell you you must take it (You think hell no)
Got a bad feeling and can't shake it (Hits so low)
When they tell you you must take it (You think hell no)
Got a bad feeling and can't shake it (Hits so low)
Lord of the game
Born to reign above all that you claim to know beyond a doubt
'Cause no one has came even close to the train of thought
We drop like neutron bombs from the tower
Which we maintain like soldiers of fame
And fortune denied as to to get by without the
Bullshit coming at me from all sides
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Told me it was all good, but they lied
Don't wait to see whites of their eyes
Death to everyone who does not recognize
Wars never done, think it is you die
Where was I now? Like I said before
Hear someone knockin' at my front door
Who could it be? Should I ignore
The knockin' or see what could be in store?
For me if I leave the safety of the shore
So many options, so little time
To do what I want 'fore the end of the line
Places its blade in the small of my spine
Is it paranoia? (Is it real?)
How long can a man enjoy what he doesn't feel?
When they ask if you can make it and you don't wanna go
When they tell you you must take it (You think hell no)
Got a bad feeling and can't shake it (Hits so low)
When they tell you you must take it (You think hell no)
Got a bad feeling and can't shake it (Hits so low)
When they tell you you must take it (You think hell no)
Got a bad feeling and can't shake it (Hits so low)
When they tell you you must take it (You think hell no)
Got a bad feeling and can't shake it (Hits so low)
Look, I'd rather be stuck naked (Hits so low)
Than waste my time like the last time and every time before that
Don't waste my time even one more time when you know that shit is whack
Don't make me remind of you of the last time you said you'd never go back
Fuck where you're from, fuck where you're goin', it's all about where you're at
Takyon
Tak, takyon (Takyon)
Takyon
Tak, tak
Triple six, five, forked tongue
Subatomic penetration, rapid fire through your skull
How I shot it on one taking it back to the days of trying to lose control
Swerving in a blaze of fire, raging through my bones
Oh shit I'm feeling it, takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah, I feel like killing it, takyon
All right that's tight, what it's like to experience, takyon
Out of the blue, in through the back
Door coming through like, "Fuck, what was that?"
Man I don't know, but it made me feel so heated how we creep without showing you jack
Shit from below, give a shit if you know 'cause even if you did, you'd keep coming back
Back for more, need it man you're addicted to the heat, we make beats catch
Beat it till it bleeds to death, each track, epileptic seize every head we crack
Like EPMD snapping necks as we tap energy from everything on and off the map (Takyon)
Oh shit I'm feeling it, takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah, I feel like killing it, takyon
All right that's tight, what it's like to experience, takyon
Takyon, shot down your throat like a keg of beer
Choke on the smoke we in and exhale till the whole chamber is clear
Haters act so fucking weird, try to stain this atmosphere
But they can't 'cause it's way too sheer, how to make a hater disappear
Take shit where it ain't never been, fuck what you thought could not comprehend
This shit if I fisted your brain with a ten, nine, eight, seven, triple six, five, forked tongue
Criminal level crunk lightning storm, get out the way or get up torn
Ain't a picture big enough to fit what we dig up from the core
Of all that they forgot ever was, militant march of this war
Takyon, taking them down all we see is blood
Takyon, turning them out, how to trick out and freak that buzz
Oh shit I'm feeling it, takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah, I feel like killing it, takyon
All right that's tight, what it's like to experience, takyon
Lunar eclipse forcing you to trip off the moonlit fire we spray
Cryonic haunted bullets hollow tipped with toxic waste
So here's the deal, if you don't feel ill, don't want it nowhere near my zone
That shit is dead, can't nobody get with that shit gets dial toned
Takyon, bitch slapping pussy clots and clones
Takyon, setting off Unabombs inside your dome
Give it up, bitch, you know this is it
Get with this or get left 'cause it's on, takyon (Takyon)
What ya gonna do when they come for you?
A gang of hatin' pigs
What have they ever really done for you?
Ain't never done shit
Stash what you got 'cause they're comin' through
Best get rid of that quick
'Cause when they get here you know what they're gonna do
All they ever do is trip
Minding my own business
Minding my own business
Minding my own business
Minding my own business
Try to hem me up like for life stuck in the klink, haters in blue
How they set me up? Should I test my luck?
Here they come, they're in pursuit
What did I do? What haven't I done? You want to see my ID? Umm
Well, ok, where I'm coming from? Just on my way, not on the run
What you want me to say? Are you just 'bout done?
Power trippin', asshole lickin' haters
Notice how they strut through the spot like anybody wants to see a cop
Man, everybody knows they suck, I got to be somewhere 'round fuck
Why the hell you always stoppin' me 'round the clockin' me, like what?
What ya gonna do when they come for you?
A gang of hatin' pigs
What have they ever really done for you?
Ain't never done shit
Stash what you got 'cause they're comin' through
Best get rid of that quick
'Cause when they get here you know what they're gonna do
All they ever do is trip
Six feet deep below the street so they can't never say shit again
Fuck the man with a thick broomstick and put a black flag on the end
Got to watch my back or just like that, I'm bound to get locked up
The law's watching me constantly too close and way too much
Looking over my shoulder and checking in the rear view mirror
'Cause I'm never not but a moment from getting taken to jail
They're knocking at my door, down my door
They're shining lights in my eyes, exactly what do they stand for?
Ever asking more of I, man, why?
Like it matters why I chose to ignore all the laws I've been told to abide
Think I'm on parole, thinking I just stole some shit, you got an APB out on
But no, you're wrong as usual, hell no, it wasn't me
Have the nerve to ask me if I'm drunk when I'm pissing in the middle of the street
Looking over my shoulder
Looking over my shoulder
Looking over my shoulder
Looking over my
By the way why they always acting like they know how to size me up
Ignorant bastards coming after me all the time on mine, had enough
Why they always wanna hassle me, pigs all up on my nuts
Like they have to be, like I can't see 'em tryin' to play shade tree in the cuts
By robbing me of my dignity so in the end, I never say much
But ain't a time pass I don't wish I could flash on Penelope like fuck
Shot this for everyone who's been there for my real ones who understand
What it feels like to have your rights read to you by the
Klink klink klink klink
Klink klink klink klink
Klink klink klink klink
In the land of the funk
Raised up through the hip hop and the punk
South sac, feel my mental
Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself
Useless information occupies every open space inside your skull
You know what's going on every day, every night
Everywhere swear you're so international
Upside-down cross on the Jumbotron, wait up, hold on
Blowing anthrax off my palms, say what? You're wrong
Switch stance, face plant, napalm fire starters
Flatlander, plug puller, nosedive turbulence chartered
You speak in abbreviations because real life conversation moves too slow
You're the media's creation, yeah, your free will has been taken and you don't know
Fuck yourself, choke yourself
Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself
Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself
(You need to vibrate higher)
Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself
Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself
(You need to vibrate higher)
Never seen without one hundred, she's a satanic priestess
Anarchy on ice freak flag flying faceless elitist
Crow on the down low end, reppin' Orion's belt
Atlantis ancient vagina getting dusty on the shelf
Enter the pigs don't get it, no hands I'm shattering jaws
Double nickles on the dime, fuck glam can lick my balls
Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself
Whatcha gonna be when you're grown young blood? Gonna be a helpless drone
Won't ever have to think, no your head'll be linked directly to your cell phone
The virus is alive, I can see it in your eyes, the infection is full blown
Career killer, double decker packed with suicidal brides
Four armed fury in a filthy dream about splitting your bitches' thighs
Enters through unknowing eyes, touch the keys, it's in your mind
Can't delete it and soon you'll find how bad you need it all the time
Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself
Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself

Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself
Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself

Shiva slashin' through your flat screen, is nowhere for you to hide
Strangled by anaconda thumbs to the soundtrack of world genocide
My thoughts tie knots in silver spoons, vampire on the rise
Punk a chump with a cunt for brains platoon in the zone and on the grind
Dead matter disposer from the mountains without peaks
Catch and release
Time released horse capsule swallowed to wake the savage beast
Keep up or get left behind
Culture shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself
Gotta get them outta here now
Infected, act so weird, how'd you get it? You're pathetic
Quarantine the virus, God law
Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself

You need to vibrate higher so you can capture the opening of the portal that connects this earth of 3D to one earth of 4D or 5D

Why can't I just float through the walls? Through the walls
Why can't I just float through the walls? Through the walls
(If you're delusional, your call will be transferred to the mothership)
I'm coming through, thought you knew, fuck if you didn't, fuck you
Plutonium lore, what this is, what this for
Feel my fists push black holes through your bitch ass decor
Spit it back like a whore and make you shit your fucking drawers
Scared to ride, cowards fall before my eyes, sound of my balls
Dragging like cannon loaded wagons, drug by demons down your halls
Can't imagine what's fit to happen when I get to flashing, see the small
Shrink to a fraction of what their lacking and less than that in no time at all
Can't believe they have the gall to try and act
Like they're not trapped between these walls, bring it, bring it, kill it
Bring it, bring that shit heated, sling it, bring back that shit, kill it
Bring it, bring that shit heated, sling it, bring back that shit, kill it, kill it
Bring it, bring that shit, I said bring it, bring back that shit, bring that
Bring it, bring that shit, I said bring it, bring back that shit, bring that
Bring it, bring that shit heated, sling it, bring back that shit, kill it
Kill it, kill it, kill it
Sometimes feel like I'm close but never get there, never get there
Does it mean I'm a ghost if I'm still here? Wanna leave here
And if I am why can't I just float through the walls? Through the walls
And if I can, were they even ever there at all? Not at all
Too much time spent in the maze will drive you mad, I feel so bad
Been there so long I can't remember who I am, or where I stand
But in the end I guess I just don't give a damn, twist a gram
And keep on sticking with the original plan, fuck it man
Judge you no more than I wish to be judged, even on the low
But I do know what you do not speak of, don't know but it shows
Try to hide but I see who you are because I just know
Keep talking but you already said too much, there you go
How it is now's how it always was, that's on my blood
How it is now's how it always was, that's on my blood
Bring it, bring that shit heated, sling it, bring back that shit, kill it
Bring it, bring that shit heated, sling it, bring back that shit, kill it, kill it
Bring it, bring that shit, I said bring it, bring back that shit, bring that
Bring it, bring that shit, I said bring it, bring back that shit, bring that
Bring it, bring that shit heated, sling it, bring back that shit, kill it
Kill it, kill it, kill it
See my blood spill drip, by chances
Try to chill, quit, 'cause I can't just slip into azagthoth trance
Tongue hissing, serpent chants
Come again work it in, yeah just like that
We paint our insides black as the shadows 'hind our flesh
And make all that we lack, the part of life that we forget
All praise due to the fact that we've forgotten how to sweat it, check it, bring it, kill it
On everything I own, swear would rather slit my throat
And die on the run than be the one who ends up hangin' from that rope
Tied to the thumb of the man who comes to empty your pockets when you choke
Got to get that shit myself and get the fuck out of this game before
I end up getting stuck with no one but myself to blame, all the way insane
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Trying not to let the feeling, tear you apart
But the silence is buzzing and it won't stop
Get it
Get it
Get it
Known for it
Get it
Get it
Known for it
Known for it, been through it
Done everything I can to it
Road to it till I broke through it
Never was attached to it
Took all I had in a flash knew it was bout to crash
So I mashed through hit, known for it
Had to do it, hacked into it
I pay the price to roll with it
Waste your life and you won't get it
Played out with nowhere to go bet it
Makes you feel like a ho don't it?
Don't it? Known for it
I pay the price to roll with it
Waste your life and you won't get it
Played out with nowhere to go bet it
Makes you feel like a ho don't it?

Let them eat shit and die as I creep lit
Off the deep hits with a sick mind
On the secrets I rely 'pon to freak this
Get it
You can tell me what you said, go ahead but no sooner than you said it
You can bet it was left for dead all you said in and out of my head in seconds
Keep 'em guessin endlessly, never let 'em know where you're headed
King of the unknown cloaked in mystery
How to show 'em they don't mean shit to me
Put 'em in their place 'cause they ought to be
Kept in the dark, no posted see never only so much of me
Double OG with a skeleton key
Never meant a thing to me, effortlessly dead to me
Check the sign no vacancy, extremely selective memory
Known for it, gotta stay deep in the zone or it'll take everything you own, floor it
Get it, get it
I pay the price to roll with it
Waste your life and you won't get it
Played out with nowhere to go bet it
Makes you feel like a ho don't it?

I pay the price to roll with it
Waste your life and you won't get it
Played out with nowhere to go bet it
Makes you feel like a ho don't it?
Don't it? Known for it
Known for it since way back, all about it, never been without it
How to ride it inside out of the clouded by the enemy surrounded
Thoughts that make you feel lost don't doubt it, you might just need it
Already did that can't never go back
Yeah fuck that, gets the bozack
Laid on the gas, leaned back and blew it
Twelve gauge blasted out abused it
Left it for the next, hit eject done with that
You want it you can have it, no questions asked
Left that shit on the side of the road in a ditch, don't trip
If ya have one, let a man so I could flip a bitch and kill it (Get it)
Head for the hills when it makes you feel
Like you can't ever chill no more, fuck it
Every time I get it to wind, round my finger and recline
Behave or be slayed 'cause I will be damned if mine ever decays
Forever on attack, gut check the blind (Get it)
Game recognize game is tight
Bow down or get banged for life
'Cause I am known for it
I pay the price to roll with it
Waste your life and you won't get it
Played out with nowhere to go bet it
Makes you feel like a ho don't it?
Don't it? Known for it

Don't it? (Get it) Known for it
Known for it Tell yourself it's almost over but it's not
Been working way too much need to get out and get fucked up
What's going on, where's it at?
Make some calls to make it crack, let's see
I need money, drugs, a ride
And a spot with hot ones inside, the mission
To get all of the above in a limited amount of time
I can do this and it's done
Like that we're on our way
Be it acid on the tongue, cocaine in your brain
Or some weed that hits your lungs like a runaway train
Hell yeah, from DMT to MDMA
Got all that shit and more so till dawn we're okay but anyway
Fuck a line, every time
Get in, get a drink and lose our minds
All eyes on the dime that makes your dick want to grind
Know you got a good buzz going
'Cause everything is glowing
Skirt so short her ass is showing
And she's looking so you're knowing you could get it tonight
But there's so much around
Best take your time do it right
As you keep getting higher
Lights look like they're on fire
Soon all that's left of you is your most primal desires
Ass clappin', dick suckin, lock the door to the bathroom, quick fuckin'
Find a whore and it could happen
But it's nothin' 'cause you're drunk and you'll be blackin' out
Before you even get a chance to think bout what you're doing
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch?
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch? Beeotch
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch? Beeotch, beeotch, beeotch, beeotch
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch?
Getting looser and looser and looser and losing yourself
In the groove that has the whole party movin'
You're cruisin, you don't know what you're doing
And you don't give up 'cause you're so liquored up, you throw it up
And keep on riding 'cause your timing is on
And that fine one is on you, it's time to get gone
Too far up in it to yawn, till it's finished, come on
Get more twisted and bomb the dance floor till it breaks
Start to pondering rape, me, I'm all 'bout the face
But it takes all kinds so pay no mind to the taste
Want to hear that song, you know the one with the bass
That makes their asses gyrate, forget to hydrate
Till they're so fucked up they take off all of their clothes and whip
It on me like my body's made to fit 'tween their lips
You got the ones on their grill or between their hips
But either way, I must say I really don't give a shit
Long as it's done well and they promise not to tell
We could do this like an orgy in the bowels of hell
Where every Lucy's hella horny and their pussies don't smell
Argh
Where's it at?
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch? Beeotch, beeotch
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch? Beeotch, beeotch, beeotch, beeotch
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch?
Responsibility's cool, but there's more things in life
Like getting your dick rode all fucking night
By the kind of girl that knows how to keep her shit tight
Legs in the air, looking like they feel nice
Volcano pussy melt your peter like ice
And the drugs got you going back for more 'cause you're like
I just can't get enough of that cum clutch, well alright
It's time to find one and take one right now
It's time to find one and make one say, "I'm down"
Think I just found one, 'bout to break one off, meanwhile
Hallucinating crazy, getting lost for miles
May have gotten too fucked up 'cause I forgot how to smile
Gonna have to do this shit Jim Morrison style
Will it work? Probably not, but it's worth a try
First hot one I see with sex in her eyes
Will be the hot one I need to take home with me tonight
Wish me luck, give me dap and I'll talk to you later
And when I do lets hope my story isn't all about haters
Where's it at, 'cause I want it like man
Got the drugs but need a hot one that'll make me go damn
Was the most banging guts that I ever have smashed
If you got it push it up on me 'cause I'm feeling that ass, know what I mean?
Where's it at?
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch? Beeotch, beeotch
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch? Beeotch, beeotch
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch? Beeotch, beeotch, beeotch, beeotch
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch? Beeotch
I want it I, I need it, need it to make me feel heated
Shake it, can't take it, must break it
Break if off yeah, what'd I say bitch?
Pass that shit
Hold on man, park the car
I have no idea where we are
Think we may have drove too far
Yeah, I can see they're right behind us
But there's nothing we can do
We can't get caught slipping get off that shit and just be cool
They're on to us but don't look now
They think they're 'bout to take us down
Fuck that I'm not going out
Pass that shit
At the next corner, turn left, it's time to handle this
Nowhere to go don't trip have no time for that pussy sh-agh
In a minute it'll all be finished what, you don't think I speak the truth?
You think I could just be sittin' here listenin' to Sonic Youth
Anywhere when they try to ride on you thinking I'm gone
I'll creep up on 'em from behind and break 'em off one by one
In the time it takes you to blink your eyes, shit'll already be done
But just in case anything goes wrong, keep your right hand on your
So when they step up out the car
Yeah I know this sounds bizarre
But now I remember where we are
Do what I say and you'll be fine
To the left of the off ramp, in the shade
Under the highway, digging graves
Blood creepin' while you're sleepin' steady creepin', blood creepin'
Shake the bottle, what's it hold?
How many have I already sold
Hope not too much 'cause I feel insane, need more than one to numb the pain
Slithering through my brain
Thoughts stuck on that train
Off the track and up in flames
Fuck it I'll swallow these blue ones, yeah, and maybe this big one
And I might as well take a few more with me just in case I get some
I know you want 'em yeah no problem
Got that covered tramp I brought 'em
How it creeps up on me so slowly I don't notice my eyes rolling
To the back of my head and falling, shit somebody's calling
Can't answer the phone, call 'em back when I'm 'bout to leave
Can't think straight man I'm so fucking blown
So when they step up out the car
Yeah I know this sounds bizarre
But now I remember where we are
Do what I say and you'll be fine
To the left of the off ramp, in the shade
Under the highway, digging graves
Blood creepin' while you're sleepin' steady creepin', blood creepin'
Down the alleys in the middle of the night
I'm trashed, so high it's hard to ride my bike
Might crash whenever I'm this fucked up
Drunken monkey through the cuts, who gives a fuck?
To the left of the off ramp, in the shade
Under the highway, digging graves
Blood creepin' while you're sleepin' steady creepin', blood creepin'
To the left of the off ramp, in the shade
Under the highway, digging graves
Blood creepin' while you're sleepin' steady creepin', blood creepin'
